# Spiral of a matrix

Given a matrix <br>[[1,2,3,4], <br>
               [5,6,7,8],  <br>
               [9,10,11,12],<br>
               [13,14,15,16],<br>
               [17,18,19,20]],<br>
 it's spiral is given by:<br> [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 19, 18, 17, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15, 14, 10]<br>
 <b>matrix_spiral.ipynb</b> contains the code to find the matrix spiral.
