# Spiral of a matrix

Given a matrix [[1,2,3,4],
               [5,6,7,8],
               [9,10,11,12],
               [13,14,15,16],
               [17,18,19,20]],
 it's spiral is given by: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 19, 18, 17, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15, 14, 10]
 <b>matrix_spiral.ipynb</b> contains the code to find the matrix spiral.
